    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "[Generative models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_model) have gained a [lot of attention](https://openai.com/blog/generative-models/) in deep learning community which has traditionally leveraged [discriminative models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discriminative_model) for (semi-supervised) and unsupervised learning. In generative modeling, the idea is to collect a huge amount of data in a domain of interest (e.g., pictures, audio, words) and come up with a trained model that generates such real world data sets. This is an active area of research needing mechanisms to scale up training and having large datasets. As stated in the [OpenAI blog](https://openai.com/blog/generative-models/), such approaches may be used to perform computer aided art generation, or morph images to some word descriptions such as \"make my smile wider\". This approach has found use in image denoising, inpainting, super-resolution, structured prediction, exploration in reinforcement learning, and neural network pretraining in cases where labeled data is expensive. \n",
    "\n",
    "Generating models that can produce realistic content (images, sounds etc.) mimicking real world observations is challenging. Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is one of the approaches that holds promise. A [quote](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-recent-and-potentially-upcoming-breakthroughs-in-deep-learning) from Yann LeCun summarizes GAN and its variations as the most important idea in the last 10 years. The original idea was proposed by [Goodfellow et al](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2661v1.pdf) at NIPS  2014. In this tutorial, we show how to use the Cognitive Toolkit to create a basic GAN network for generating synthetic MNIST digits."

The two conflicting objectives between the sub-networks ($G$ and $D$) leads to the GAN network (when trained) converge to an equilibrium, where the Generator produces realistic looking fake MNIST images and the Discriminator can at best randomly guess whether images are real or fake.
